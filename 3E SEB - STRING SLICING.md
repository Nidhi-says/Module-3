## SEB - SPLIT STRING

### AIM  
To write a Python function that accepts the mail id and breaks the string based on "@" using an appropriate built in function.

### ALGORITHM
1. Define a function `splitstring(s)` that splits a string at `'@'`.
2. Take input from the user and store it in variable `s`.
3. Call the function `splitstring(s)`.
4. Inside the function, use `s.split('@')` to split the string wherever `'@'` appears.
5. Print the resulting list after splitting.

### PROGRAM
```
def splitstring(s):
    print(s.split('@'))
s=input()
```

### RESULT
Thus a Python function that accepts the mail id and breaks the string based on "@" using an appropriate built in function is successfully implemented.
